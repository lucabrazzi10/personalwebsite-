	<h1><center>About Me</center></h1>
	<p><center>I was born in Warri, Nigeria, and I am the second child in a family of four siblings. I am the second to last child in a family of seven. Both of my parents are businesspeople and they instilled in me the importance of hard work and determination from a young age. I have always been a curious and ambitious person, eager to learn and try new things. I did well in school and was a top student. After completing my secondary education, I moved to Romania where I studied Naval Transportation and Marine Engineering at Constanta Marine University.</center></p>
	<p><center>I started my IT career as a website designer (HTML) and Linux/Unix System Engineer at UiPath in Bucuresti, Romania. Later, I began freelancing with Accenture in Bucuresti as a DevOps & AWS Engineer. I moved to the United States and am now a citizen. I have previously worked on different projects with different companies, such as BASF Corporation. Currently, I am working as a DevOps Infrastructure Engineer at Graphic Packaging International.</center></p>
	<p><center>I am an expert in using Amazon Web Services (AWS) including EC2, S3, RDS, ECS, Elastic Load Balancer, and Auto Scaling groups. I have configured and maintained Jenkins to implement a continuous integration process and integrated it with Maven to schedule builds. I have also managed deployment automation using Docker and Terraform to automate system operations. I have automated the creation of platform environments by writing ansible playbooks in YAML. In addition, I have experience with system administration of Windows and Linux virtual machines, including support, maintenance, and automation of configuration and installations using ansible.</center></p>
	<p><center>In my free time, I enjoy participating in sports, particularly soccer, and playing in tournaments. I also enjoy reading books and articles on a variety of topics. In my personal life, I value honesty, integrity, and kindness. I believe in treating others with respect and empathy, and I strive to live my life with purpose and positivity.</center></p>
